## Career Roadmap
Follow this step-by-step journey to become a skilled Ethical Hacker:

1. **Foundation (0-6 Months)**  
   - Learn networking basics: TCP/IP, subnetting, and OSI model.  
   - Study operating systems (Linux and Windows) and command-line usage.  
   - Explore cybersecurity fundamentals: CIA triad, common threats.  
   - Practice on platforms like TryHackMe or Hack The Box (beginner rooms).  

2. **Core Skills (6-12 Months)**  
   - Master reconnaissance tools: Use Nmap and Wireshark for network scanning.  
   - Learn Python or Bash for basic scripting (e.g., automate scans).  
   - Understand web vulnerabilities: Practice SQL injection and XSS on labs like DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App).  
   - Earn an entry-level certification (e.g., CompTIA Security+ or CEH).  

3. **Intermediate Hacking (1-2 Years)**  
   - Dive into penetration testing: Use Metasploit to exploit systems in legal labs.  
   - Test web apps with Burp Suite: Intercept traffic, find flaws.  
   - Practice social engineering: Simulate phishing with SET in controlled environments.  
   - Build a home lab (e.g., VirtualBox with Kali and vulnerable VMs).  

4. **Specialization & Certification (2-3 Years)**  
   - Specialize in an area: Network security, web apps, or cloud hacking.  
   - Pursue OSCP: Complete the rigorous Penetration Testing with Kali Linux course.  
   - Participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges on platforms like CTFtime.  
   - Start contributing to bug bounty programs (e.g., HackerOne, Bugcrowd).  

5. **Professional Growth (3-5 Years)**  
   - Secure a junior penetration tester or ethical hacker role.  
   - Conduct full-scope pen tests: Recon, exploitation, reporting.  
   - Write detailed reports: Translate technical findings for non-technical clients.  
   - Expand skills to cloud platforms (e.g., AWS penetration testing).  

6. **Senior Level (5+ Years)**  
   - Lead penetration testing engagements for large organizations.  
   - Develop custom exploits or tools, sharing them with the community (e.g., GitHub).  
   - Mentor junior hackers and teach at workshops or conferences.  
   - Transition to roles like Security Architect or Red Team Lead.

## Tips for Advancement
- **Stay Legal**: Always obtain explicit permission before testing systems.  
- **Build a Portfolio**: Document CTF write-ups or bug bounty successes on a blog or GitHub.  
- **Network**: Attend cybersecurity events (e.g., DEF CON, Black Hat, local OWASP meetups).  
- **Stay Updated**: Follow exploit databases (e.g., Exploit-DB) and security blogs (e.g., Krebs on Security).  
- **Specialize**: Focus on niches like IoT hacking, mobile apps, or red teaming.  
- **Practice Continuously**: Use platforms like Hack The Box or VulnHub to hone skills.
